Group Project - Problem Statement
Health & Fitness App
You have been contracted to create an application that empowers a user to monitor and track their progress along their health journey. The application should offer a suite of tools that allows a user to record, analyze, and set goals for different aspects of their life.

Feature Summary
Health
The application should allow users to track and set goals for a variety of health-related aspects of their life.

Tracking

Users can create a profile and have a dashboard with a summary of their current health and fitness progress
At a minimum, users can track their:
Daily calorie intake
Weight
Sleep
Goals and Reporting

Users can set daily, weekly, or monthly goals for each tracked aspect
Users can view their historical data for each aspect
Users can get statistics about their progress toward a goal over a specific timeframe
Users can set reminders for daily tasks
Fitness
The application should allow users to monitor their exercise in a variety of ways.

Trainer Led Exercise

Trainers use the application to create exercise plans. These plans can be either self-paced or a scheduled class
Self-paced plans include information about required equipment, recommended fitness level, average session length, and suggested frequency
Scheduled classes include information about the date, time, and days of the week the class occurs, the length of the class (i.e. session length and number of weeks the class lasts), recommended fitness level, recommended or required prerequisites, and required equipment
Trainers can limit the number of participants in the class
Trainers can see information about their plans and classes. For example, they can check how many people have signed up for a plan and fully completed it or how many people are registered for one of their classes
Personal Exercise

Users can track their daily exercise
They can record individual workouts, including information like duration, type of exercise, calories burned, etc.
They can track their daily step count
They can create templates for their favorite workouts
They can set reminders to start a workout
Users can register for Trainer created exercises
They can add a self-paced plan to their account
They can sign up for and attend trainer-led classes
Users can set goals for weekly exercise and view reports on their progress
Bonus
The application provides social functionality, allowing a user to challenge and encourage other users. Examples:

Users can friend each other and then send exercise challenges, send encouraging messages, or congratulate them for achieving a goal
Users can join a group and set group challenges
General Requirements
It is very important to keep in mind that the requirements do not include all corner cases and validations that are needed. These are just a few examples to get you started. Part of your project is to think about each use case and discuss what would be the best solution with your team. If you have doubts, ask me. Example: What happens when a user tries to join a class that is full or doesn’t meet the prerequisites?

These are the requirements for a general user:

A general user should be able to log in to the system using a username and password
A general user should be able to log daily calorie intake, weight, and sleep
A general user should be able to record a workout
A general user should be able to search for and sign up for self-paced plans
A general user should be able to search for and sign up for and attend trainer-led classes
A general user should be able to set goals and track their progress
A general user should be able to see their historical trends
These are the requirements for a trainer:

A trainer should be able to log in to the system using a username and password
A trainer should be able to create self-paced exercise plans
A trainer should be able to create exercise classes
A trainer should be able to modify their plans and classes
A trainer should be able to start and end a session of a particular class
A trainer should be able to view statistics about their self-paced plans and classes
These are the requirements for an admin:

An admin should be able to log in to the system using a username and password
An admin should be able to view all the general users and trainers
An admin should be able to reset passwords
Some examples of topics to discuss with your team while designing the application:

Should an admin have access to a general user’s data?
What information should a trainer know about their students?
What are the potential tradeoffs between functionality and usability?
The minimum scope of the full implementation (with GUI connected) expected for the Iteration 3 final demo:

A general user should be able to:
Create an account with a username and password
Log in to the system using a username and password
See a dashboard of their current progress
Log daily information, like calorie intake and weight
Record a workout
Search for self-paced exercise plans and add them to their account
Search for classes and register for the class
Attend an in-progress class
See a report of their historical data and goal targets
A trainer should be able to:
Create an account with a username and password
Log in to the system using a username and password
Create a self-paced exercise plan
Create and register a class
Host a session of a class
Modify an existing plan or class
View reports about their plans and classes
An admin should be able to:
Log in to the system using a username and password
Add a user to the system
Reset a user’s password
Bonus Features

A general user should be able to friend another user
A general user should be able to challenge a friend
A general user should be alerted when a friend reaches a goal
A general user should be able to join a group
A group should be able to post challenges
A trainer should be able to message a class’s participants
